# WHAT IS THIS
This is a small data-gathering project I worked on during Winter 2021-2022. It is an imperative script that creates a database of US colleges from USNews.

# HOW DO I USE THIS?
Run the lone python file in terminal using python3. Feel free to change the number in the range function in main to whatever you desire (it is defaulted to 50, meaning it will collect 50 pages of colleges). A database file will then be created in the working directory.

# WHAT CAN I EXPECT IN THE FUTURE?
Expect a vast change: cleaner datasets, easier to read results, and perhaps even more information about colleges.

# IMPORTANT NOTE
All publicly accessible data collected belongs to USNews. I do not claim to own this data, I am just collecting and reorganizing it.
